# Knight's Tour Problem with SFML

## Problem
The Knight's Tour problem is a puzzle where the goal is to move a knight on a chessboard to visit every square exactly once. The knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and one square in a perpendicular direction. The challenge is to find a solution where the knight covers all 64 squares without revisiting any square.

## Approach
### Solution: Backtracking with Warnsdorff's Heuristic
The solution is implemented using the **backtracking algorithm**. The knight starts at a given position and explores all possible moves. If it reaches a dead-end (no valid moves), it backtracks to the previous position and tries a different path. To make the search more efficient, **Warnsdorff's rule** is applied. The rule suggests moving to the square with the fewest onward moves.

### Board Setup
- The board is 8x8, with each square represented as a `ChessNode`.
- Each `ChessNode` knows its position, color (black or white), and the valid knight moves it has (up to 8).
- The knight moves based on these connections.

## Classes

### ChessBoard Class
- **Purpose**: Manages the chessboard grid and connections between nodes.
- **Initialization**: Creates an 8x8 grid of `ChessNode` objects, where each node represents a square.
- **Connections**: Each node is connected to its valid knight move positions. This is done using an array of possible knight moves.

### ChessNode Class
- **Purpose**: Represents a square on the chessboard.
- **Properties**:
  - Position (x, y)
  - Valid knight move connections
  - Color (black or white)
  - Method to toggle highlighting (used to show visited squares).

### Knight Class
- **Purpose**: Handles the knight's path calculation and movement.
- **Path Calculation**: Uses backtracking to calculate a valid path that visits all squares.
- **Movement**: The knight moves across the board every 1.5 seconds, and its position is updated using SFML for visualization.
- **Visualization**: A knight sprite (image) is used to represent the knight, and it moves according to the calculated path.

## SFML Visualization
- The chessboard and knight are displayed using SFML.
- The knight's movement is shown as it moves from square to square on the chessboard, following the path generated by the backtracking algorithm.
- The knight's position is updated every 1.5 seconds.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artisenpaiii/knight-s-tour-problem
   ```
2. Compile the project with your preferred C++ compiler, ensuring SFML is linked correctly.
3. Run the executable.
4. The chessboard will appear, you can click on the chessboard tile to see the valid moves for the knight.
3. press the "Enter" key to start the knightâ€™s tour. OBS remove all previous hightlited squares.
4. The knight will move across the chessboard, visiting every square one by one, visualized using SFML.
5. To run it again, press enter again.

### Modifify start position

Change the condinates here... (Main.CPP)
```cpp
  ChessNode* start_node = board.getNode(5,5); // CHANGE HERE
